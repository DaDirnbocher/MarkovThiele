UNDER DEVELOPMENT 

*Goal of package*
This package aims to 
- define an R-class for inhomogeneous discrete markov chains
- functions to ease the construction of such objects
- functions to evaluate the expected value, higher moments and the distribution of the markov chain
- supply sample data for generic markov chains in the insurance sector

*Installation of package*
The package can be installed via devtools::install_github("manalysis/MarkovThiele")

*Contributions*
Feel free to provide improvements of the code or extend functionalities. The following is a list of open TO-Dos from my point of view:
- define an function to check the validity of a defined markov chain
- create a function that computes the higher moments
- find a set-up to include homogeneous markov chains
