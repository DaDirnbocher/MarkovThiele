Type: Package
Title: The package allows the user to construct and evalute markov chains
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Markus Ausserhofer
Description: The package defines a markov-chain-S3-object, offers functions to construct with the desired parameters and offers functions to evaluate and analyse such markov chains.
    The user can compute the expected value of the cashflows as well as higher moments, especially variance and curtosis
    Also the user can compute the distribution function of the markov chain using an approximation as well as evaluating the distribution function for one given u.
